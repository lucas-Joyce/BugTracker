# Introduction
> ## Purpose
> Bug tracking is an exciting process of discovering and fixing errors in software! It's like a thrilling treasure hunt where developers are on a mission to uncover and remove any pesky bugs. Finding errors in complex software systems can be challenging, but it's also incredibly rewarding to see a project come to life after all the bugs have been eliminated. With the right bug tracking tools, teams can ensure that software is working as intended to provide a seamless user experience.
>
> ## Document Conventions
> A bug tracker is an essential tool for any software development team, as it helps document the life cycle of any bugs that are encountered throughout the development process. With a bug tracker, teams can detect, track, and monitor any bugs, defects, or other issues that arise, and then work to eliminate them.

 # Product Description
> ## Product Perspective
> A good bug report should be concise yet informationally dense, and should only contain one bug. In addition, it should include details of the environment and user steps that would allow the developer to reproduce the bug on their own. Reproducing the bug is essential to debugging, as it ensures the developer is not stumbling in the dark. By providing this information, teams can ensure their bug reports are as effective as possible.
> ## Product Feature
> A user-friendly interface is essential for a successful bug tracker, and should include customizable fields for gathering pertinent information about the bug. 
> These fields can include text, drop-down lists, checkboxes and more, allowing users to easily input the bug environment, module, severity, and other important details. 
> By having these fields available, users can ensure their bug reports are as effective as possible and can be easily tracked and monitored.
> ### User Types
> Bug tracking is a collaborative process, and should involve multiple user types. 
> Normal users can log a bug, while the team decides which bugs should be in scope for the project, which should go into the main backlog, and which should be addressed during the next iteration, sprint, or cycle. 
> By involving multiple user types, teams can ensure that the bug tracking process is as efficient and effective as possible, leading to the highest quality of products.
> ### Contraints
> Required fields for the bug report. <br>
> Note that the required fields of the bug report are: <br> 
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  **Bug Summary**,  <br>
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  **Severity**,  <br>
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  **Steps to reproduce**,  <br>
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  **Actual Result**,<br>
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  **Expected Result**.<br>
>
> ## Assumptions
> It helps testers function better, easily report and fix bugs. <br>
> Testers can view and utilize all the information required to resolve issues, <br>
> which enables faster development, verification, and releases of updated versions or even, <br>
> feature fixes. Faster releases make happier customers.
> ## Risks
> Complications can arise out of confusion over descriptions, lack of information, tools that <br>
> are overly cumbersome and require mandatory fields for which the user doesn't have the answers, <br>
> and difficulty in reporting.
