# Introduction
> ## Purpose
> Bug tracking is the process of logging and monitoring bugs or errors during software testing. 
> It is also referred to as defect tracking or issue tracking. 
> Large systems may have hundreds or thousands of defects. 
> Each needs to be evaluated, monitored and prioritized for debugging.
>
> ## Document Conventions
> A bug tracker is a software development system used to document the life cycle of bugs. 
> As a result, bug tracking describes the structured process from detection, tracking, and monitoring to the elimination of bugs, defects, and other problems.
>
> ## Scope
> &nbsp;  *In Scope* <br>
> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  javascripte uses single system for users <br>
> &nbsp;  *Out Scope* <br>
> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  external system pull request
 # Product Description
> ## Product Perspective
>  A good bug report should contain only one bug and be clear and concise yet informationally dense. <br>
>  It should contain environment details and user steps that allow the developer to reproduce the bug on his side. <br>
>  Without being able to reproduce the bug, developers are essentially stumbling in the dark.
> ## Product Feature
> A user-friendly interface with customizable fields for gathering pertinent information about the bug. <br>
> It should include custom fields such as <br> 
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  *text*, <br>
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  *drop-down lists*, <br>
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  *checkboxes*, <br>
> where users can easily input the bug environment, <br>
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  *module*, <br>
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  *severity*, <br>
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  etc.<br>
> ### User Types
> This is normal - anyone can log a bug. <br> 
> The team decides which bugs are in scope for the project and which need to go into the main backlog. <br> 
> The team decides which bugs get fixed when they're planning the next iteration/sprint/cycle.
> ### Contraints
> Required fields for the bug report. <br>
> Note that the required fields of the bug report are: <br> 
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  **Bug Summary**,  <br>
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  **Severity**,  <br>
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  **Steps to reproduce**,  <br>
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  **Actual Result**,<br>
>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  **Expected Result**.<br>
>
> ## Assumptions
> It helps testers function better, easily report and fix bugs. <br>
> Testers can view and utilize all the information required to resolve issues, <br>
> which enables faster development, verification, and releases of updated versions or even, <br>
> feature fixes. Faster releases make happier customers.
> ## Risks
> Complications can arise out of confusion over descriptions, lack of information, tools that <br>
> are overly cumbersome and require mandatory fields for which the user doesn't have the answers, <br>
> and difficulty in reporting.
